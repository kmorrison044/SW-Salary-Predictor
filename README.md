# SW_Salary_Predictor_W_PCA
I continue my work in my previous SW engineering salary predictor by reducing the dimensionality of the feature space using Principal Component Analysis. This will help algorithms that suffer from the curse of dimensionality. It will also help decorrelate the feature space so that the model will stay balanced.
